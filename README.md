# Solves problems from "Elements of Programming Interview" in Java (Adnan Aziz et all)

- Merge Sorted Lists
- Reverse LinkedList (iteratively)
- Reverse sublist
- Segregate even and odd nodes in a LinkedList (!EPI)
- Detect Overlapping Lists
- You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and
  each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. (Microsoft)
- Write a function to delete Kth node from behind in a single linked list

## Dynamic Programming

- Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns an integer representing the maximum
sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. If a sum cannot be generated, the function should return 0 (!EPI).

- Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non-negative integer representing
a target amount of money, implement a function that returns the number of ways to make change for that target
amount using the given coin denominations. Note that an unlimited amount of coind is at your disposal. 

- Solve Levenshtein distance problem.

## Tree

- Solve a descendant tree to find the Youngest Common Ancestor given the root node, and two descendant nodes.

## Recursion

- Write a function to generate all permutations of a given array of elements
- Write a function to generate Powerset of a given set
